About me
======
I'm Benoît Guérand, a machine learning graduate from both Arts et Métiers ParisTech (ENSAM) and Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT). I studied engineering and particularly machine learning. During my last year of university I wrote my master thesis in computer vision under the supervision of [Dr. Mustafa Demetgül](https://sydsen.aifb.kit.edu/21_376.php) and Fabian Scheer at Mercedes-Benz.

After university I took 2 years to become a professional water-polo player in Spain as it is something I could not postpone for after my career.
