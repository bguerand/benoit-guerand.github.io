title: "Deep Learning for the Detection of Car Flap States"
collection: publications
category: conferences
permalink: /publication/WSCG_conference
excerpt: 'In recent years, deep learning and object detection has continuously attracted more attention. Especially in the automotive world where many car manufacturers are currently investigating its possible applications. On production lines, even if processes are more and more automatized mistakes can happen and hinder the performance of an industrial plant. In this study, a method and application of object detection-based deep learning algorithm to detect open flaps on cars, like doors, trunk, hood etc. is examined. With this approach, the advantages of gap detection in cars on production lines, specifically the application of Resnet50 Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and transfer learning in an industrial use case, are demonstrated. We show how the problem of detecting open flaps on cars is modeled in a way that a CNN can be applied to this new kind of application and present a detailed evaluation of the results and challenges. Finally, many suggestions are given for future applications of similar algorithms.'

In recent years, deep learning and object detection has continuously attracted more attention. Especially in the automotive world where many car manufacturers are currently investigating its possible applications. On production lines, even if processes are more and more automatized mistakes can happen and hinder the performance of an industrial plant. In this study, a method and application of object detection-based deep learning algorithm to detect open flaps on cars, like doors, trunk, hood etc. is examined. With this approach, the advantages of gap detection in cars on production lines, specifically the application of Resnet50 Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and transfer learning in an industrial use case, are demonstrated. We show how the problem of detecting open flaps on cars is modeled in a way that a CNN can be applied to this new kind of application and present a detailed evaluation of the results and challenges. Finally, many suggestions are given for future applications of similar algorithms.
